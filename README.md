# StupidInjector

---
Because it would be stupid to use it for anything else but educational purposes. 

## Why?
StupidInjector is the simplest dependency injector I could write, as a simplified demonstration of how dependency injectors work.

## What should I use then?
You should probably use SimpleInjector.
