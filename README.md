# StupidInjector

---
Because it would be stupid to use it for anything else but educational purposes. 

## Why not?

Nothing is optimised, there is no testing beyond the small toy example in the code. I am probably not going to maintain it. Bug reports will probably fall on deaf ears.

## Why?
StupidInjector is the simplest dependency injector I could write, as a simplified demonstration of how dependency injectors work.

## What should I use then?
You should probably use SimpleInjector.  

## Interesting exercises

If you want to fork the project and play around with it, you may have some fun adding features to see how they would work. For example:

1. Support Collections of injections
2. Support lifestyles for objects (lots of fun to be had here)
3. Add a container verification class, to check if the container config is good
4. Check for circular dependencies in the container.
